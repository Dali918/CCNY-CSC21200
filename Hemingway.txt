The quintessential novel of the Lost Generation, 
The Sun Also Rises is one of Ernest Hemingway's masterpieces and a classic example of his spare but 
powerful writing style. 
A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces 
two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. 
The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s
Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. 
It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. 
First published in 1926, The Sun Also Rises helped to establish Hemingway as one of the greatest writers of 
the twentieth century.

Synopsis of Novel;
The Sun Also Rises follows a group of young American and British expatriates as they wander through Europe 
in the mid-1920s. They are all members of the cynical and disillusioned Lost Generation, who came of age 
during World War I (1914–18). 
Two of the novel’s main characters, Lady Brett Ashley and Jake Barnes, typify the Lost Generation. Jake, 
the novel’s narrator, is a journalist and World War I veteran. During the war Jake suffered an injury that 
rendered him impotent. After the war Jake moved to Paris, where he lives near his friend, the Jewish 
author Robert Cohn.
